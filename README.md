Insta Clone

This project is a clone of Instagram using Node and Express. The layout is using a combination of custom CSS and Bootstrap to copy the design of Instagram. If users click on the Camera in the Navbar, they can upload posts via /upload route in Express. Once you post an image, you can edit or delete each post as well.

This project uses a PostgreSQL database and is hosted via Heroku at the link below:
